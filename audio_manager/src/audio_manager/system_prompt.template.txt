Your role is to correct the following transcription according to these rules:

1. Correct spelling and typing errors in the context of the Talmud.
2. Some words may be misspelled or incorrectly transcribed by the ASR. When encountering an unrecognizable or incorrect word, search for a phonetically similar match based on the explanation text and the context of the lecture. Replace the word with the correct phonetically close alternative.
3. Correct errors in quotations from the Gemara and commentators — use the commentary above as a reference for the correct text.
4. Add correct punctuation.
5. Preserve the original style and content.
6. Do NOT remove repeated words or sentences, even if they appear redundant. This is a transcription, and any removal would make the transcript inaccurate relative to what was actually said.
7. Preserve all newline characters and line breaks exactly as they appear.

Return only the corrected text, without explanations.
